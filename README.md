#Excecutive Summary/Abstract:
This project aims to develop a mobile application that can recommend recipes based on
selected ingredients.The idea and goal of this project are for those who are passionate
about cooking or who are not good cooks and want to make impromptu ingredients with
what they have. This app aims to solve this problem by providing an easy and user-friendly
way to identify different ingredients and recommend recipes containing these ingredients.
The research question guiding the project was: How accurately can a mobile app identify
different ingredients? How does the app recommend recipes that combine different spices
and herbs? The project team researches the different types of spices used in cooking and
the most effective ways to identify them.
Background information for the project was drawn from a variety of sources including
culinary research mobile app development and user experience design.
This team is excited to tackle this as we believe cooking is everyone's new hobby these
days. We hope the app will encourage users to try new ingredients and recipes and expand
their culinary horizons. Additionally the team is passionate about technology and saw the
project as an opportunity to develop their application development and user experience
design skills.
